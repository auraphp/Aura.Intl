# Aura.Intl

The Aura.Intl package provides internationalization (I18N) tools, specifically
package-oriented per-locale message translation.

## Installation and Autoloading

This package is installable and PSR-4 autoloadable via Composer as
[aura/intl][].

Alternatively, [download a release][], or clone this repository, then map the
`Aura\Intl\` namespace to the package `src/` directory.

## Dependencies

This package requires PHP 5.6 or later; it has been tested on PHP 5.6-8.1. We recommend using the latest available version of PHP as a matter of
principle.

Aura library packages may sometimes depend on external interfaces, but never on
external implementations. This allows compliance with community standards
without compromising flexibility. For specifics, please examine the package
[composer.json][] file.
